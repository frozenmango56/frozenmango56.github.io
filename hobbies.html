				  <dt>Playing the Piano</dt>
				  <dd>Another hobby of mine is that I play the piano. 
				  I take piano lessons through the Masaki School of music.</dd>
				  <dt>Swimming</dt>
				  <dd>I like to go swimming, whether it is in a pool or snorkeling in beaches around the island. 
				  While snorkeling I have seen lots of interesting underwater sea life.</dd>
