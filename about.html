        <p class="description">My name is Isaac Haisler and I was born on July 20th, 2009. 
		I was born in Texas but my family and I moved to Hawaii when I was around six months old. 
		I go to Roosevelt High School and have six siblings. 
		I am beginner scuba certified, which qualifies me to dive to 60 feet underwater! Last year I was enrolled in a archery 
		class sponsored by parks and recreation. I won first place in district age group 14-16. During this summer, I got many chances to go 
		bowling with my family  and was able to improve my average score and bowling technique. Before I didn't walk and bowl, I just walked up 
		to the line and then rolled the ball. This year I started learning how to do the four step approach which allows me to bowl faster and 
		better.</p>
